3-As a user , i want file analyzer to count the total number of Lines in each txt file.
4-As a user , i want file analyzer to count the total number of fields in each csv file.

*classes : fileAnalyzer, total number of words, txt files,user,total number of characters,
total number of lines,total number of fields,csv file

*functions : count

--> wordNumber,characterNumber,LineNumber,FieldsNumber all results from analyzing the file
so all in one class (analysis results)-- they have no bahaviours

analysisResults,fileAnalyzer,txtFileAnalyzer,csvFileAnalyzer --> classes

1-abstraction : analysis behaviours is interface as interface behaviour in most cases is verb
الانترفيس هتفرض عليهم انهم يعملو اناليسيز للفايلالات دي 

IFileAbalysis Interface --> have AnalyzeFile Method(File)
result found in file analyzer so txtfile & csv file inherit from it

class can inherit many interface or interface and class but cant inherit many abstract classes
